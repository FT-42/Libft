For everyone to work on their own projects, we are going to use branches. I will explain 1, how to create your own branch. 
2, how to push your own branch.

1 : To start of with, clone the repositry onto your system (git clone www.....)
2 : To create a new branch, type in the following
                git checkout -b (Your own name)
3 : To push, use the following command
                git push origin (The name that you gave your branch)
